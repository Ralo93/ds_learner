# Flashcard Application

The Flashcard Application is a Python-based study aid designed to help users create, manage, and review flashcards. The app supports various features, including categorizing flashcards, assigning difficulty levels, and tracking study progress. This app uses an SQLite database (`data.db`) to store flashcard information.

## Features

- **Add Flashcards**: Easily create flashcards by providing a question, answer, category, difficulty level, and status.
- **Edit and Delete Flashcards**: Update or remove flashcards to maintain an up-to-date study list.
- **Organize by Category and Difficulty**: Filter and review flashcards based on categories or difficulty levels.
- **Progress Tracking**: Track your flashcards' review status to focus on areas that need improvement.
- **Advanced Search**: Implement future upgrades like advanced search to enhance study focus.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Required libraries installed (if using a virtual environment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flashcard-app.git
   cd flashcard-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   (Optionally set up a virtual environment)

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate       # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate          # On Windows
   ```

   Then install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configuration**

   Create a `config.json` file in the root directory to hold your API keys or other configurations:

   ```json
   {
       "openai": {
           "api_key": "your_api_key_here"
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Initialize the Database**

   Run the application once to initialize the SQLite database as `data.db`, or use the following command to create tables based on the `Flashcard` schema:

   ```bash
   python src/app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Starting the Application**

   Launch the application by running:

   ```bash
   python src/app.py
   ```

2. **Creating Flashcards**

   Add new flashcards by specifying the following details:
   - **Question**: The question on the flashcard.
   - **Answer**: The answer to the question.
   - **Category**: The category under which the flashcard falls.
   - **Difficulty**: The difficulty level (e.g., easy, medium, hard).
   - **Status**: A status indicator (e.g., reviewed, pending).

3. **Tracking Progress**

   The app includes options to mark flashcards as reviewed or pending, helping you keep track of progress as you study.

4. **Advanced Video Search (Planned Feature)**

   We are working on implementing advanced video search capabilities, allowing users to input a query (e.g., "yellow hat") to identify frames in a video containing the specified object.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Topic Progression**: Create new questions from different perspectives resulting in a broader understanding.
- **Flashcard Stats**: Generate insights on the study session, including time spent and accuracy.
- **Customizable Categories**: Add, modify, and delete categories for better flashcard organization.

### 1. Adaptive Learning Path with AI-driven Insights
Description: Integrate an AI system that tracks each user’s progress, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and dynamically adjusts the learning path to focus on challenging topics. This system would analyze user responses over time, highlighting areas that need more attention and creating a customized review schedule.  
#### Key Features:
Real-time adjustments in the sequence and frequency of flashcards based on performance.
Targeted recommendations for high-difficulty cards if the user consistently answers similar topics incorrectly.
AI-driven insights on learning patterns, like preferred study time or topic trends, could further personalize user experience.
Benefit: This would lead to more effective study sessions, cutting down learning time by focusing on specific gaps instead of general reviews.

### 2. Smart Flashcard Generation and Enhancement Using Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
Description: Use NLP to automatically generate additional questions and answers based on each user’s existing flashcards. For example, if a user is studying biology, the AI could suggest related questions or expand on answers to provide a more comprehensive understanding of each topic.
#### Key Features:
Auto-generated follow-up questions that test the same concept from different angles.
Suggestions to rephrase or elaborate on answers to reinforce learning.
Contextual hints or mini-explanations related to each answer for difficult topics.
Benefit: This enhances the depth of study material with minimal effort on the user’s part, allowing for a more holistic grasp of each topic and reducing time needed to create flashcards manually.  

#### 3. AI-powered Progress Prediction and Motivation System
Description: Implement an AI model that predicts a user’s learning progress based on past performance and suggests optimal review intervals or intensity adjustments to reach specific learning goals. This system could also generate motivational feedback to encourage users to stay consistent, using metrics like “You’re 80% toward mastering topic X!” or “Consistent study time has increased your memory retention.”  
### Key Features:
Predictive insights showing how much time or effort is needed to reach the next mastery level for specific topics.
Motivation prompts based on the user’s achievements, study streaks, or goals.
Smart reminders for spaced repetition, tailored to the user’s learning style.
Benefit: Users can stay motivated with a clear picture of their progress and a tailored path to reach their learning goals, resulting in improved engagement and faster mastery.

# Feature Enhancements
Interview-Focused Categories: Curate flashcards specifically for common data science interview topics, such as machine learning theory, SQL, Python, and problem-solving approaches.

Difficulty-Based Progression: Since your goal is to master all levels, ensure the app dynamically adjusts question difficulty based on your progress, helping you to continually improve.

Real-World Scenario Questions: Add flashcards that mimic real interview scenarios and case studies, where you have to think through practical applications of data science skills.

Self-Assessment with Feedback: Include a feature where you rate your confidence or accuracy after each session. Based on your responses, the app could suggest areas for improvement.

Timed Practice Sessions: Since interview scenarios often test quick thinking, implement a timer to practice under time constraints. This will prepare you for rapid problem-solving in actual interviews.

# Incentives for Continued Use
Achievement Badges and Progress Metrics: Track your mastery in each category and give visual feedback on progress to motivate continued use.

Competitive Leaderboard: If you’re part of a batch or study group, a leaderboard could add friendly competition, encouraging regular usage and improvement.

Daily Goals and Streaks: Use streaks and small goals to motivate daily practice, reinforcing incremental improvement and knowledge retention.

### Mock Interview Simulations: Integrate a feature where you complete random flashcards simulating an actual interview, creating a practical and immersive practice experience.

Expert Tips After Questions: After answering, show insights or “expert tips” related to each topic to deepen your understanding beyond just the answer.
